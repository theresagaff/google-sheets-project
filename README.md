# Google Sheets Pitch

Theresa Gaffney

As members of the Baby Boomer generation age, many have decided that they don’t want to become a snowbird and fly to Florida, while others never had southern escape as a financial option. Because of this, the senior population in New York is growing (and projected to grow) at a rate many times faster than the rest of the population. While it’s not the borough with the highest number of seniors—that’s Brooklyn—the Bronx is projected to see the fastest growing population of residents 60+ over the next 20 years. This means that Bronx senior residents will need more resources and funds from the city.

Potential sources for this story include: a representative from the NYC Department of Aging, senior residents in the Bronx including those living in senior housing or NYCHA, a reprensentative from the Census Bureau, staff from Bronx hospitals, and many others.

I can pitch this story to some of the local NYC outlets, who report on borough to borough issues: Gothamist, Mott-Haven Herald in the Bronx, and maybe the NY Daily News.
